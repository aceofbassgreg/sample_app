#Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). Essentially, this app is a clone of Twitter.

This is really where I learned how to use:
- TDD with RSpec
- Factory Girl
- Agile development

It also taught me how to build an app in discreet iterations and therefore was my first
foray into Agile development.
